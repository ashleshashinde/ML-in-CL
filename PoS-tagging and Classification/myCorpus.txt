request: we'll try to be real quick here. 
request:So  tell me about where you live. 
request: Go ahead.

request: You first. 
request:   Go ahead.  
request: scratch that,  
request:So  go ahead and say .  
request: Uh,  hang on one second  
request:And, you know, like  hold on here. 
request: you go first. 
request:so,  go ahead . 
request: You might try,uh,   
request: hold it down a little longer,  
request:and  see if it,uh,  
request: Push my number.  
request:and  you put it in. 
request:Well,   go in,  don't go in  the winter. 
request:  put it to sleep,you know.   
request: Just get it out,you know,   
request:   I'm telling you, go one way or the other.  
request: so,  uh, and   if you don't have the money, then use a credit card,  
request: Tell me about your home. 
request:but, um,  you have to really wash your vegetables after that  
request: so,   don't worry about it.  
request: Just let him enjoy himself .  
request:  You,  you're  first. 
request: Let's just get started. 
request:Uh,  do you want to go ahead and start? 
request: let's example,uh,   
request:Like,  for instance, say,uh,   
request: go ahead. 
request: just a minute . 
request: Wake up. 
request: Imagine the guilt that person would have.  
request:  Get the computers out   
request: Well   if you,   if you  can get GREEN CARD, go for it. 
request:Well  why don't you start cause it said I was suppose to ask you what do you, 
request: if you have a chance to rent it, at least,  
request:Well,  what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years  
request: and  when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it. 
request: Could you hold on for just a moment? 
request:so  we'll just wait. 
request:So,   well,  I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there. 
request: listen,  
request: Well,  put them in a salad, though,  
request:and  you say,well,  I made it though, at least it's mine. 
request:  now you watch,  
request:so,   we'll talk about that some. 
request: I'm going to let you kind of lead the pack,
request: tell me about your computer, Laurie,  
request: go ahead. 
request: Go ahead.  
request:Uh,   go ahead.  
request: I'll let you go first. 
request: Refresh my memory. 
request:And,  uh,  if you have that on a regular basis in Texas, I think I would go with something very dry  to keep it off,you know.  
request: Got to wait a couple years. 
request: Sledding, that is what you have got to do.  
request: Tobogganing. 
request: You have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them. 
request: Excuse me. 
request: I guess we shouldn't get into that  
request: Excuse me one second. 
request:or   you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time. 
request:And   you need to look at, when you,  if you do decide to go with child care, you really need  to,  to   look at what your options are  and,   and  look at  the,  what they  offer,  
request: drop in at times that are unexpected. 
request: What,uh,  go ahead and tell me about your home . 
request: I was about to say, you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing . 
request: I would not recommend that method. 
request:Well  I'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes  
request:and  if you discover you like it then you can always upscale. 
request: Because if you,uh,  use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out,uh,  all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto,  you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it  
request: You want it to get dry, but not,uh,  just real hard. 
request: You don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard.  
request:But   use,  use  good,uh,  stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands,
request:  If you were,  if you were  closer   I'd,  I'd,   I'd  tell you you could come over and supervise . 
request: why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next. 
request: Why don't you go ahead and start. 
request:Oh,  you should try it. 
request:and  you have to make sure  that you, um,  that you  apply pretty early, because  they do have,  a lot of places have  very long waiting lists. 
request: And,  um, and   another question to ask is if they're,um,  state certified 
request:Um,  there's a place to look into,um, um,   
request: go back to that one to ten scale where one,
request: take it to a logical extreme,  
request: I guess we should talk about giving advice,  though.  
request:Well,  it might be a good time for you   to be,  to,   to start  a tradition. 
request: You could be responsible for that yourself. 
request:But  you definitely need to go to Hawaii.  
request: Very  definitely. 
request:Anyway, so  we're supposed to be talking about places to go  
request: I would just encourage you to do a little traveling, though, before you get married.  
request:  don't,  don't  be in any hurry. 
request: You really should go to Europe.  
request:so  you should think about doing something like  that. 
request: hold on .  
request: Sure, go ahead. 
request:and  let's face it,  
request:Oh,  you've got to see that one,  
request: I would suggest seeing it at the theater.  
request: Ladies,  first. 
request:  Give them   your pen number.   sp: pin
request: go ahead. 
request: buy a fresh filet of fish, a nice one at  the fish mar,  the fish counter.  
request: Don't overcook it though. 
request:Well,  you see, just check it,you know,  during, 
request: Wait, wait, wait, H,   three?
request: Go ahead. 
request:so,  yeah,   do it as long you can . 
request: now it's up to you  
request:but  go ahead  .  
request: Go ahead . 
request:but  .Well,  tell me,  
request:  Send,  send   them to Wisconsin, 
request: Excuse me  .  
request:and,  hold on a second.  
request:  Write that one down.  
request:Well,  try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot .  
request: bit. 
request: Tell me how yours works. 
request: so.  
request:so  we've got to talk about music. 
request:like,  give me some examples. 
request: Guess.   
request: look at the Cowboys now .  
request:Well,  you'll just have to plan a vacation some time 
request: go ahead. 
request:Oh, well, well,  encourage her to try other things,  
request:Well,  I guess we have to get back to hobbies since, 
request: Stick on the subject. 
request:  Hang them.   
request:but yeah,   next time you go,uh, you know,  check into it,  
request: go ahead.

request: do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a  blessing  
request: Let's hear about your hobbies. 
request: pick out where you want to live,  
request:and then  once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do. 
request: if you don't like it, shoot, move on to something else.  
request: Go ahead. 
request: E I mean,   I,  I  would recommend you look at that book 
request:Well,  you look at places like Turkey.  
request:And, uh,  you look at their  society  
request: You look at another kind of society like the Japanese.  
request: You look at Frito Lay.  
request: You might try that.  
request: I was hoping you could tell me what you thought. 
request: Hang on a minute.
